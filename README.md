The following example application uses the epfl/mobility dataset which  contains mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, USA. It contains GPS coordinates of approximately 500 taxis collected over 30 days in the San Francisco Bay Area. You may download the dataset for your own testing from the Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data At Dartmouth (CRAWDAD).
