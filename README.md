# HeyCabbie
Demo application of a Lamda Architecture

Watch the video presentation of this demo application

This project uses code instrumentation packages in one of my other projects, Firehose https://github.com/breinero/Firehose. This dependency is not yet handled in the gradle file. That is on my TODO

The following example application uses the epfl/mobility dataset which  contains mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, USA. YOu may download the dataset here https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bi-connector-docs/logs.dsv.gz.
This dataset contains GPS coordinates of approximately 500 taxis collected over 30 days in the San Francisco Bay Area. You may download the dataset for your own testing from the Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data At Dartmouth (CRAWDAD).
